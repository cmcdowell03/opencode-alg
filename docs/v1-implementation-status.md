# V1 Phase One implementation status

PR [#14](https://github.com/cmcdowell03/opencode-alg/pull/14) implements Phase 1a/1b against main baseline 99b88cd. The candidate package is 0.5.0 and targets OpenCode >=1.18.0 and <2.0.0. It is not merged or released.

## Delivered contracts

| Contract | Implementation | Qualification boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Workspace readiness | Bounded ALG.workspace.json registry, scoped document/fact/skill requirements, known/unknown/stale/conflict states | Ordinary tool use remains advisory; mandatory enforcement covers qualified managed investigation dispatch only |
| Skill applicability | Existing skill loading and application-level approval policy, exact approved closure and current scope | No automatic trust escalation, silent repinning, or new measured-promotion policy |
| Investigation state | Independent durable ledger, typed session pointer, bounded hypothesis/evidence/checkpoint records | Bulk data and the large knowledge map remain in datalake-mcp |
| Remote work recovery | Work identity, durable admission and reservation, unknown-outcome lookup, fresh result validation | Deduplication applies to the managed route with a qualified service, not arbitrary direct MCP calls |
| Compaction and task changes | Bounded projection in normal/compaction hooks; restart reconciliation; durable task-detachment intent | A summary is a projection, never the only copy of investigation state |
| Research graph | Fixed data-investigation graph with bounded fan-out and fresh checking | No recursive orchestrators or automatic graph rewriting |
| Analytical authority | Reported analytical outcome separate from execution completion; engineer review binds the exact evidence before confirmation | Model output and execution success do not establish causal truth or remediation authority |
| Deployment | Platform-specific prepared bundle, pinned Git object bytes, exact dependency inventory, approved manifest, existing transactional manager | Dependencies are prepared before transfer; deployment is offline; runtime and host versions are checked |
| Local acceptance | Windows PowerShell and native Ubuntu Bash in dedicated WSL; deterministic local provider and official MCP SDK fixture | No GitHub runners, paid model calls, production queries, or user-global config changes |

## Operator entry points

See [V1 investigation usage](v1-investigations.md), [deployment](deployment.md), and [headless acceptance](v1-headless-testing.md). Workspace and investigation features are opt-in. Enabling an adapter requires a qualified service profile with the actual endpoint's schemas and behavioral evidence; the synthetic test profile is not a production approval.

The single Bash deployment command uses an already prepared bundle and a separately reviewed manifest digest:

```bash
bash "/path/to/opencode-alg/scripts/alg.sh" deploy --offline --trust-bundle <reviewed-manifest-sha256>
```

Use isolated --config-dir and --install-root overrides when evaluating a candidate. A successful deployment means installed on disk; an existing OpenCode process must restart before it loads the new generation. The new candidate writes state older 0.4.1 schemas do not understand, so rollback to that version is rejected.

## Remaining qualification and later milestones

Local acceptance results are recorded separately with exact commits and evidence identities. An interrupted or failing test run is not a pass, and a source-checkout run is not a packaged-installation run.

The real air-gapped datalake-mcp service has not been inspected or qualified. Deployment there still requires its schema/identity, caller scope, submission lookup/idempotency, execution limits, retention and result validation probes. WSL qualifies the tested Ubuntu environment; it is not evidence for every native Linux distribution or libc.

Measured skill promotion, curated outcome cohorts, optional artifact-building skill qualification, graph selection/improvement, recursive graph authoring, and shared multi-user knowledge remain subsequent V1 milestones. OpenCode V2 implementation remains excluded.
